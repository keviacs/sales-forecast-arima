# Sales Forecast ARIMA

This repository contains a time series sales forecasting example using the ARIMA model in Python.  
The dataset is synthetically generated with trend and seasonality components to simulate daily product sales.

## Project Overview

- Simulates daily sales data for multiple products with trend, weekly and yearly seasonality, and noise.
- Uses the ARIMA(2,2,2) model to train on historical sales data and forecast future sales.
- Splits data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Visualizes real sales vs model predictions.
- Calculates performance metrics like RMSE and MAE.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`sales_forecast_arima.ipynb`) in Google Colab or locally.
2. Run the cells sequentially to generate data, train the ARIMA model, predict, visualize, and evaluate.
3. Modify the parameters or product selection to experiment with different setups.
